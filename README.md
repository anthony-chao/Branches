# Branches

## Background and Overview
Branches is a project management tool that allows logged in users to deconstruct their projects into manageable tasks while also enabling them to visualize the completion status of the project.

Branches will help users structure and visualize the workflow of their projects through the tree visualizer. The tree visualizer breaks down the projectâ€™s tasks by determining what tasks can be done at the current moment. Tasks that require previous steps to be completed will not be prioritized until the prerequisite tasks are completed. This provides project team members a clear indication of what tasks are upstream and where potential bottlenecks are.

Project managers will be able to invite project team members to collaborate on branches.

Branches will allow project managers to distribute the workflow by assigning roles and tasks to project members. In addition, project managers will be able to set deadlines for tasks. Deadlines can be seen visually in a calendar.

Branches will also allow project members to discuss matters related to the project or raise questions, concerns, issues or provide updates through a project chat.
